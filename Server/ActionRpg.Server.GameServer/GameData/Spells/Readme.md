# How spells work
* Spells belong to a main spell category
* Spells have defined schools
* Spells have defined range
* Spells have defined min/max damage if they can do damage
* Damage spells indicate a dice count which represents how many attacks (pulses) should be fired
* Dice delay indicates how much time (in milliseconds) before the next pulse fires
* Damage type indicates what type of damage should be applied if the spell hits
